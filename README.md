# Ferrumio

Open source tools for developers on AWS.

We build the libraries and utilities we wish existed. Things that save time, run fast, and just work. Sometimes that means Rust under the hood. Sometimes pure Python. Sometimes just a clever script. We optimize where it matters.

## Our Tenets

**Developer experience first.** Tools should help, not frustrate. If it's hard to use, we'll make it easier.

**Performance where it counts.** We don't optimize everything — just the parts that actually slow you down.

**Simple by default.** One import. One decorator. Sensible defaults. You can always customize later.

**We use what we build.** Every tool here started as something we needed ourselves.

**Open source always.** Free to use, free to fork, free to improve.
